## Github action for Contextual QA Checklists

Tests are nice, but sometimes you want an additional checklist of items to check before merging a PR
(for example, grammar check for documentation changes or last-minute check of visual look).
This action allows you to build filename-based checklists to remind the PR author about.

The action reads a checklist specification file (by default `CHECKLIST.yml`) from the repository root and submits a checklist comment to new/modified PRs based on what files were modified.

### Example

#### Checklist specification

`CHECKLIST.yml`

```yml
paths:
  "README.md":
    - Did you remember to add code examples for newly added methods?
    - Did you make sure that all the example code still functions as expected?
    - Did you remember to update screenshots to match new updates?
  "src/components/**.js":
    - Did you check that the component visual look still matches design documents?
  "docs/**":
    - Did you run changes past the copywrite team?
```

Only one property, `paths`, is supported at the moment. It takes path specifications as key and a list of items as value.

#### Action
